If Table “BATCH_JOB_INSTANCE” is not found, that means it didn’t create automatically on console:
example
http://localhost:8080/h2-console/login.do?jsessionid=e80779ebefdc32d93dd020ee888b84eb

, you have to set it manually. The SQL schema can be found here on this same directory on schema-db2File.sql file
